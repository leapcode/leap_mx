MailReceiver service definition. This service monitors the incoming mail and
process it.

The MailReceiver service is configured to process incoming any skipped mail
every half an hour, and also on service start. It can be forced to start
processing by sending SIGUSR1 to the process.

If there's a user facing problem when processing an email, it will be
bounced back to the sender.

User facing problems could be:
- Unknown user (missing uuid)
- Public key not found

Any other problem is a bug, which will be logged. Until the bug is
fixed, the email will stay in there waiting.
